	<h1>I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Swimming is my most fovorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it mine. </p><br>
		There are three reasons I like to swim:
		<ul>
			<li>I get losts of experience</li>
			<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
			<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
		</ul>
